# Smart Contract Developer Coding Challenge
As the next step in the hiring process, weâ€™d like you to complete a coding challenge.

## The Project

Your task is to write a smart contract that creates your own ERC20 token and build a small Dapp for it, using React.

## Requirements

1. Write a smart contract that implements the ERC20 standard plus some custom functionality. This could be anything around dividend payouts, a whitelist to restrict trades to a certain set of users, burning and minting new tokens or something we can't even imagine. Surprise us.
2. Create a new React app that interacts with your smart contract(s) in a useful way.
3. Create a README.md explaining how to test the features you have built. Feel free to add additional thoughts, e.g. why you chose certain libraries or why you implemented a feature in a certain way etc.

## Additional Information
* You are free to use any third-party libraries.
* Have fun and be as creative as you like!
* Please feel free to reach out to ask any questions.

## How to Submit This Challenge
1. Fork this repository.
2. Work on your solution.
3. Deploy your smart contract to a testnet of your choice.
4. Create a pull request with @github/apquinit and @github/edilsalvador as the reviewers. Send us an email at charlie.coroza@twala.io and CC paul.quinit@twala.io and edil.salvador@twala.io when you're ready to have it reviewed and schedule the tech interview.
5. Include in your README documentation the steps on how to setup and run your project on another local machine.

## Timeframe

We would like the take home challenge to be completed within 3 days. If you need more time, please reach out to us. You will not be judged on how quickly you complete the challenge.
